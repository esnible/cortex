# Tests for authbridge/install.sh.
#
# install.sh is a curl|sh entry point, so its failure modes are other people's
# first experience of Cortex. Until this file existed the only automated check was
# `shellcheck --severity=error`, which is why the tag-parser bug (returning the
# OLDEST release from compact JSON) shipped in #902 without a test.
#
# Approach: source a single function out of install.sh with `curl` replaced by one
# that prints a fixture. No network, no GitHub, no downloads. Plain POSIX sh
# because the repo has no bats or shunit2 and a framework is not worth it for a
# handful of functions.
#
# Run: sh authbridge/install_test.sh

# shellcheck disable=SC1007 # `CDPATH= cd` is deliberate, not a typo: it empties
# CDPATH for this one command. The documented invocation is `sh
# authbridge/install_test.sh`, so $0 is RELATIVE — with a CDPATH set, `cd` can
# resolve it against a CDPATH entry and land somewhere else entirely.
