// Process attribution files a request that carries no session header under the session of
// the PROCESS that sent it, rather than by User-Agent (client affinity) or by timing
// (ActiveSession). A listener that can name a connection's process — core/peerproc, on a
// laptop install — passes the client's chain: the client first, then its parents.
// Everything here is inert until a listener calls ClaimProcess or SessionForProcess, which
// only one with process attribution on does.
//
// SessionForProcess walks the chain from the client up and, at each process it knows:
//
//	1. Named a session through its own session header (ClaimProcess): its most recently
//	   active live session. A process that never named one — a tool an agent's shell ran —
//	   is bound to that answer the first time it is seen, and keeps it for its life.
//	2. An agent's (its requests carry a known coding agent's User-Agent) that has named no
//	   session yet: that agent's pending bucket, which the first session it names adopts.
//	   Stopping here is what keeps a nested agent — a claude -p run from another session's
//	   shell — out of its parent's session.
//	3. Named sessions, none of them live now: "", so resolution falls back — it is no other session's.
//	4. Bound earlier: that session.
//
// No agent anywhere in the chain is the default bucket while some process has named a
// session within ambiguityWindow, and "" otherwise, so ActiveSession() answers as before.
