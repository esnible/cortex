// BenchmarkRetainedHeapWithTools reports what the tool manifest costs a session, which is
// the term BenchmarkRetainedHeap does not exercise at all — and was the largest one in a
// live proxy before the schemas were interned: measured at 84KB per event, 4.1x the JSON
// text, because they were held as map[string]any.
//
// Two sub-benchmarks, because a single figure cannot show what interning did:
//
//   - shared: every turn re-sends the SAME manifest, which is what a real client does.
//     One copy per session survives.
//   - distinct: every turn's manifest differs by one nonce field, so the table can never
//     match. Standing next to `shared` it prices the duplication that was being paid.
//
// Measured when this was written: shared 2.78MB/session, distinct 7.53MB — the tool term
// collapsing from ~5.3MB to ~0.6MB.
//
// What `distinct` is NOT is a reproduction of the old cost. It prices duplication only,
// and the field it replaced was a map[string]any, which cost 4.1x its JSON text to hold
// on top of being duplicated. The real change is therefore larger than the ratio here,
// and the map figure is not reproducible in this tree by design — the type is gone.
//
// The interleaved tunnel-open in the loop below is load bearing, not incidental colour.
// With it present and InternEvent's contentless-event guard removed, `shared` measures
// 31.33MB/session against 2.79MB — 11.2x, because every turn's table was being cleared
// before the next turn could match it. Any change to the rolling table should be measured
// on THIS shape rather than on a clean run of turns, which is not what live traffic is.
