# install.sh — one-line installer for Cortex on a local machine.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rossoctl/cortex/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
#
# Detects your OS/arch, downloads the prebuilt `agentop` and `cortex` binaries for
# the newest stable release, verifies their SHA-256 checksums, and stages them in a
# temporary directory. Then it hands off to `agentop setup --from <stage>`, which
# lists what it will change, asks once, installs to ~/.local/bin, starts Cortex with
# its built-in config in ~/.cortex, undoes what it did if a step fails, and deletes
# the stage. macOS + Linux, amd64 + arm64. No cluster, Keycloak, or SPIRE needed.
#
# This script keeps only what has to happen before there is an agentop to run: the
# bootstrap below, the download, the checksums, and the extract. It prints little of
# its own: the download's progress (on a terminal a title and a bar, which stay on
# screen; one plain line otherwise), errors, and a few warnings and notices from those
# steps, such as a dump helper it could not fetch or a TMPDIR that would not run
# programs. The rest comes from setup. Traffic is decrypted and parsed for viewing;
# nothing is rewritten.
#
# Options (pass through the pipe with `sh -s --`, e.g.
#   curl -fsSL ...install.sh | sh -s -- --install-only):
#
#   --install-only     install the binaries and PATH, and stop
#   --claude-code      also route Claude Code through Cortex, so it runs as plain
#                      `claude`. Setup asks before changing anything.
#   --no-modify-path   never edit a shell profile
#
# The rest are in `--help`. Each one this script shares with setup is passed on.
#
# There is deliberately only one config. It carries the parsers AND tool-prune,
# and the proxy preserves edits to it, so a second "cost-optimised" config had
# nothing to do that filling in one list did not already do — while costing a
# second CA, a second set of paths, and a second page of instructions that read
# identically to the first.
#
# No compatibility aliases here: this script accepted no flags at all until now,
# so there is no earlier spelling for anyone to still be using. (The proxy's
# --demo -> --local alias is different: that flag really did ship.)
#
# Flags rather than env vars: written `VAR=1 curl ... | sh` the variable reaches
# curl, not sh, so the script runs without it — the failure mode is silent, and
# `sh -s -- --flag` does not have it. That is why the env aliases for --ref and
# --install-only were removed rather than kept as a second spelling: they were the
# form most likely to be typed and least likely to work.
#
# By default this script re-runs the copy from the newest stable RELEASE rather than
# executing whatever is currently on main — main is unstable by definition, and a
# `curl | sh` should not be the first thing to run a change nobody has released.
# --ref=main opts back in; --ref=vX.Y.Z pins, and is the only way to get a release
# candidate (--ref=vX.Y.Z-rc.N), which the default never picks.
#
# Every path here installs a RELEASE. To install what is in a checkout instead,
# use `make dev-install` from the repo root: it compiles both binaries to ./bin and
# runs the same handoff, `./bin/agentop setup --from ./bin`. --ref=main is not that —
# it only chooses which copy of this script runs, and that copy still downloads a
# build.
#
# Environment (maintainer testing only — not part of the documented interface):
#   AUTHBRIDGE_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1  download nothing; hand the agentop already in
#                               ~/.local/bin to `agentop setup`, which re-checks
#                               and repairs what is installed
# set -eu, not -euo pipefail: this is POSIX sh (the documented entry point is
# `curl ... | sh`), and `pipefail` is a bashism that would abort the script under
# dash/ash. The repo-wide `set -euo pipefail` convention applies to bash scripts.

# There is deliberately NO sandbox-detection probe here. We never try to GUESS whether
# a sandbox will block launchd/systemd or /tmp — a passive probe cannot tell (a
# permissive `(allow default)` seatbelt profile is a real sandbox that still lets
# launchctl and /tmp work, while a restrictive one does not), and the earlier
# heuristics (/tmp writability, `getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR` returning EIO) reported the
# wrong thing under a permissive profile. The reliable kernel-level answer,
# sandbox_check(getpid(), NULL, 0) == 1 (what Chromium's Seatbelt::IsSandboxed uses),
# tells you that you ARE sandboxed but NOT whether any given operation is denied —
# which is the only thing this installer cares about.
#
# So instead of detecting and pre-deciding, we ATTEMPT each restricted operation and
# handle what actually fails: ensure_tmpdir writes-then-falls-back to a scratch dir
# under ~/.cortex, the exec probe re-stages there when TMPDIR will not run programs,
# and agentop setup does the same for the supervisor (a real `launchctl list` /
# `systemctl --user` probe, then a plain background process). Nothing assumes the
# sandbox is restrictive; nothing assumes it is permissive either.

# ensure_tmpdir guarantees TMPDIR names a directory we can actually write, and is
# exported. mktemp (used by the bootstrap and the download) and the release-tag scratch
# file all honour TMPDIR; in a sandbox that denies /tmp, an unset or /tmp-based TMPDIR
# makes every one of them fail. Falling back under CORTEX_DIR keeps all scratch state in
# the one directory this installer already owns.
#
# An existing TMPDIR is used AS-IS — never overwritten with a normalised copy. We only
# choose a value when the environment gave us none. Either way TMPDIR is exported on the
# success path, so a later "${TMPDIR}" is safe under `set -u` even where the environment
# never set it (routine on Linux; launchd hides this on macOS by setting a per-user one).

install.sh — install Cortex on a local machine (macOS/Linux, amd64/arm64).

Usage:
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rossoctl/cortex/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
  curl -fsSL ...install.sh | sh -s -- [option]

Downloads agentop and cortex for the newest stable release, verifies their checksums
and stages them, then hands off to `agentop setup`. Setup lists what it will change,
asks once, installs to ~/.local/bin, and starts the proxy with its built-in config
in ~/.cortex. Traffic is decrypted and parsed for viewing; nothing is rewritten.

Options:
  --install-only     install the binaries and PATH, and stop
  --claude-code      also configure Claude Code to use it, so it runs as plain
                     `claude` with no environment variables
  --local            the default, spelled out
  --no-service       do not use the OS service supervisor (launchd/systemd); run
                     the proxy directly as a background process instead. Chosen
                     automatically when the supervisor turns out to be unavailable
                     (e.g. a macOS seatbelt sandbox that blocks launchctl)
  --no-modify-path   never edit a shell profile; only say so when ~/.local/bin is
                     not on PATH
  --stop             stop a running Cortex and exit — the supervised service if one
                     is installed, and the background proxy from its pidfile. Does
                     not download, install, or start anything. Safe to re-run.
  --yes, -y          do not ask; apply the changes setup lists
  --ref=REF          install from a git ref instead of the newest stable release —
                     both this script and the binaries (e.g. --ref=main for
                     unreleased changes, --ref=v0.8.1 to pin). The only way to
                     get a release candidate: --ref=v0.9.0-rc.1
  -h, --help         this text

Undo any time:
  agentop uninstall

After installing, to cut Claude Code's token cost:
  agentop tools scan --write ~/.cortex/config.yaml   (proposes which tools to prune)
Then watch the $ saved on every prompt Claude Code sends, live in:
  agentop

The session store is memory-only. To write it to files before it is lost:
  cortex-session-dump --out ./cortex-dump
