// deliberately absent from the CI matrix — the binary needs CGO and libcpex_ffi.a from a
// pinned release, so build.yaml covers it through the image build — so these run under
// `go test -tags cpex ./cmd/cortex-cpex/` locally rather than on every PR. Stated
// rather than left implicit: a test nobody runs is worth less than one that runs, and the
// import guard below is the half that matters most if this module ever joins the matrix.
