const bobUsage = `abctl configure bob — route IBM Bob through Cortex via its settings.json

Usage:
  abctl configure bob enable  [--yes] [--settings PATH] [--config PATH]
  abctl configure bob disable [--yes] [--settings PATH] [--config PATH]
  abctl configure bob status  [--settings PATH] [--config PATH]

Flags:
  --yes            do not prompt for confirmation
  --settings PATH  IBM Bob's settings file. Defaults, on macOS only, to
                   ~/Library/Application Support/IBM Bob/User/settings.json
  --config PATH    Cortex config to read the proxy address from
                   (default ~/.cortex/config.yaml)

IBM Bob is a VS Code fork, so it has a settings file and one flat key decides
where its networking goes: "http.proxy". enable sets it to Cortex's forward
proxy, read from ~/.cortex/config.yaml so the address always matches the proxy
that is actually running. Only that one key is written — every other setting is
left exactly as it was, and the first write copies the original to
settings.json.bak and never overwrites that copy.

disable removes "http.proxy" ONLY when it points at Cortex. A value that does
not — a corporate proxy, say — is reported and left alone, because a proxy abctl
did not write is not abctl's to delete.

The proxy is only half of it. Bob's requests are terminated by Cortex's TLS
bridge, so Bob must also trust the bridge CA, and that is an OS trust-store
change abctl does not make for you: it needs sudo, and a tool that silently
escalates to alter machine-wide trust is not one you can audit. enable prints
the command that does it, disable prints how to undo it, status prints how to
check it.

"abctl configure bobshell" is a different thing and the two are independent.
That one defines a "bob" shell function so typing "bob" runs through Cortex;
this one configures what the editor does on its own.

Comments: VS Code permits them in settings.json and this command does not. It
reads the file as strict JSON and refuses a commented one by name rather than
rewriting it, because a rewrite would silently delete the comments.

Exit status: 0 applied, already correct, or reported; 3 declined — at the prompt
or because there was no terminal to ask on; 1 something went wrong; 2 a usage
error.
