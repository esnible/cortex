// Called only from goTop/goBottom — `g` and `G` — because those are the two
// gestures that already mean "take me to an end". An arrow key that happens to
// reach row 0 is navigation, not a statement of preference, and treating it as one
// would flip the setting under an operator who was simply scrolling.
//
// Persisted immediately rather than on pane exit: there is no "closing" event for
// a session view (Esc, [l], a pod switch and quitting all leave it), so waiting for
// one means the common paths never save.
