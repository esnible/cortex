//
// The label is pipeline.EventClient.Label — "claude-code/2.1.270", or the raw User-Agent for
// an agent the parser did not recognise. CLIENT-ASSERTED AND SPOOFABLE, like every other use
// of that field: a display and scoping key, never an authorization subject.
//
// NO SESSIONS COUNT, and that absence is deliberate rather than pending. session.SessionSummary
// carries no agent, and the cost ledger's key is (endpoint, model, agent, provenance) with no
// session dimension BY DESIGN — so "how many sessions did this agent have" is not a question
// anything on the wire can answer, and a column here would have to invent it.

// The snapshot carries per-agent figures PER BUCKET, while this pane shows one row per agent

// snapshot fetched with usage.GroupAgent; any other grouping yields rows labelled by that
// grouping's keys instead, which is the caller's error to avoid and not something this can
// detect — Bucket.Series does not record which axis produced it.
//
// THE FOLD ITSELF IS usage.FoldSeriesAcrossWindow, not a loop here. It saturates through
// Counts.Add rather than wrapping, and `abctl cost --agent` needs the identical answer — two
// copies would be two definitions of what a window total means. The drawer's rankSeriesByCost
// records what the alternative cost when it did write its own: a wrapped total ranks BELOW a
// ten-micro series, which here would sort the busiest agent to the bottom of the table.
//
// ORDERED BY usage.SortSeriesLabels, not by a comparison written here. `abctl cost --by` ranks
// the same series for the same reason, so the rule has one definition in core and both surfaces
// call it — the tie-break on the label matters more than it sounds, because every unpriced agent
// has CostMicros 0 and until billing units land the label is the entire order for all of them.
