//
// Constant in every state, for the same reason numTierRows is — layout() reserves it from
// the terminal height and paneView fills it, and a renderer whose height follows its data
// floats the footer or overflows the terminal.
//
// IT WAS TWO, stacking labels over values so their figures could share a column stride. The
// row is worth more to the sessions table than the stride was to a reader: keys.go does
// `bodyH -= spendBandLines`, so this hands a row back to the body of every pane the band draws
// on, drawer open or closed. What is given up and why it is affordable is recorded on
// TestRenderSpendBand_EveryLabelSitsBesideItsOwnFigure, which replaced the stride assertion.

// bandSeparator divides cells. A middle dot with a space either side, which is how this package
// already separates peer readings on one line — the title bar's "abctl · <url> · [Sessions]" and
// the drawer's "model · endpoint · agent" hint. Two spaces was enough when the cells were
// columns; on one line a label follows a figure directly, and "…$18.80  THIS MONTH…" runs the two
// readings together where "…$18.80 · THIS MONTH…" does not.

// THE HIERARCHY THE TWO-LINE BAND GOT FOR FREE. app.go used to mute the whole label ROW and leave
// the whole value row bright — `styleMuted.Render(band[0]), band[1]` — which folding to one line
// would have destroyed silently, muting labels and figures together into one uniform grey. The
// contrast is the thing that makes four readings scannable, so it moves down here where a cell
// knows which half is which.
//
// mute is passed in rather than reaching for styleMuted directly so this file stays free of the
// package's styles and a test can assert the geometry with an identity function.

// width is what that pair occupies.
//
// lipgloss.Width, never len() and never a rune count — the rule fitStripFigures states for
// this package and the one footer.go records the cost of breaking. It is not merely style
// here: the values carry markers and an em dash, and bandWidth's arithmetic feeds the drop
// enumeration, so a cell measured in runes would drop cells at the wrong widths.
//
// MEASURED OFF render() rather than summed from the halves, so the separating space is counted
// once and in one place. Summing is how a one-column drift gets into a budget.
//
// It does NOT fix an East-Asian ambiguous width, and it is worth saying so rather than leaving
// the next reader to assume it did. U+2014 is ambiguous-width, and a terminal under an EA locale
// gives it two columns while lipgloss v1.1.0 reports 1 either way — measured, including with
// go-runewidth's EastAsianWidth forced on, where runewidth says 2 and lipgloss still says 1. So
// an em-dash band under that locale under-counts no matter which of these two functions is used;
// what changes is that the band now under-counts the same way the table, the strip and the footer
// do, instead of in its own private way.

// bandDropOrder is the order cells are given up in as the terminal narrows, FIRST DROPPED
// FIRST. It is deliberately NOT the visual order.
//
// The band reads left to right in ascending span — the hour, the day, the week, the month —
// because that is how a reader zooms out from "right now". Dropping in that direction would
// give up the month first, which is the budget figure and the reason three of these spans
// exist at all. Dropping in reverse would give up the hour, which is the live one.
//
// So the two ends survive and the middle yields: the week goes first, then the hour, leaving
// TODAY and MONTH — "what have I spent today" and "how much of the budget is gone" — as the
// last two readings on a narrow terminal. Every cell still drops WHOLE and nothing is ever
// clipped, which is the rule a truncated money figure breaks.
var bandDropOrder = [numSpendSpans]spendSpan{span7d, spanHour, spanToday, spanMonth}

// renderSpendBand is the always-on spend band: ONE LINE, each label inline with its own figure,
// one cell per budget span, separated by bandSeparator.
//
// FOUR COST CELLS AND NOTHING ELSE, and the exclusion is the design rather than an omission.
// The band used to carry TODAY, LAST 1H, SAVED, CACHE HIT and TOKENS, and three of those five
// had no span on them at all — CACHE HIT and TOKENS were read off the rolling-hour snapshot
// while sitting in a row that opened with TODAY, so an hour's token count read as a day's, with
// nothing on screen to tell a reader otherwise.
//
// IT SUPERSEDES #1074, which fixed the same defect a different way and landed while this was in
// review. That change kept all five cells and suffixed each label with its span — "TOKENS 1H",
// "CACHE HIT 1H" — grouping the row into a day run and a window run. It is a smaller change and
// it does make every cell name its period.
//
// This goes further because the cells were not only mislabelled, they were the wrong cells: an
// operator reads spend against the hour, the day, the week and the month, and the old five could
// reach two of those. Suffixing labels makes a heterogeneous row honest; replacing it with four
// readings of ONE quantity over four periods makes the row comparable, which is what the uniform
// width and right alignment below are for. #1074's divider survives untouched — it is orthogonal
// and closes the top block whatever the band holds.
//
// THE INVARIANT THAT REPLACES THEM: every cell's label names the period its figure covers.
// Cost-only satisfies it trivially, because spendSpanDefs gives each span its label; any cell
// added later has to satisfy it too. The volume readings are not lost — the drawer's tier
// column says the cache story with more detail, the sessions table carries per-session tokens
// and savings, and the Usage pane keeps the full metric set.
//
// MARKERS, NOT PROSE. Each money value comes from moneyAmount, so the three disclosure glyphs
// ride on the figures; moneyFigure's parenthesised caveats do not fit one line beside four
// readings. The marker is the fact and the words are the explanation, and `abctl cost` is the
// surface with room for both.
//
// PAIRED BY ADJACENCY, which is what replaced the uniform-width stride when the band folded to one
// line. The two-line form stacked labels over values and right-aligned both in cells of ONE shared
// width, because four readings of the SAME quantity left-flushed in cells of their own widths put
// "$4.04" and "$703.18" four columns apart and a reader scanning down could not compare them.
//
// A single line has no column to scan, so that property is not weakened but inapplicable — and
// what takes its place is stronger: "TODAY $18.80" is one unit, and no arrangement of neighbours
// can pair a label with another span's money. What is genuinely given up is that two cells of
// unequal width no longer put their decimal points near each other. The row buys that back in the
// sessions table; see spendBandLines and
// TestRenderSpendBand_EveryLabelSitsBesideItsOwnFigure.
//
// THE SELECTION IS SPLIT OUT FROM THE JOIN so the band can be drawn twice from one decision: plain
// for the width arithmetic and the assertions, muted-label for the screen. See renderSpendBand and
// renderSpendBandStyled, which differ in nothing else.

	// THE BEST FITTING SET, chosen by enumeration rather than by dropping until it fits.
	//
	// Four spans is sixteen subsets, so the whole space is cheap to search — and searching it is
	// what makes the answer both MAXIMAL and MONOTONE IN WIDTH. Dropping greedily is neither.
	// Every cell shares one width, so a single wide cell inflates the budget for all of them, and
	// a loop that stops the moment the set fits keeps whichever wide cell it has not reached yet:
	//
	//	measured, with a five-figure TODAY carrying all three markers ("!~$17265.97+", 12 columns)
	//	  width 25 -> LAST 1H  7 DAYS  MONTH      three cells, 3x7 + 2x2 = 25
	//	  width 26 -> TODAY  MONTH                two, because 2x12 + 2 = 26 also fits
	//
	// Widening the terminal by one column LOST a reading, and it stayed lost through width 39. A
	// put-back pass cannot repair that: it can only un-drop cells, never surrender the wide one
	// that is inflating the shared width, so it never reaches the three-cell set.
	//
	// CHOSEN BY VALUE, NOT BY COUNT, which is the whole point of having a drop order. The weight
	// below gives each surviving cell a bit, most valued highest, so maximising it prefers the set
	// that keeps MONTH over any set that does not — and only then more cells. A weight determines
	// its set uniquely, so nothing else is needed to break a tie.
	//
	// RANKING BY COUNT FIRST INVERTED THE ORDER, and every cell sharing one width is why: three
	// narrow cells are cheaper than two that include a wide one. Measured, with a month just over
	// $999.99 ($4.04 / $18.80 / $216.44 / $1234.56):
	//
	//	width 24 -> TODAY  MONTH
	//	width 25 -> LAST 1H  TODAY  7 DAYS      the month gone, the week back
	//	width 28 -> LAST 1H  TODAY  MONTH       the month returns
	//
	// So at 25 to 27 the band hid the budget figure and showed the week instead — the exact
	// inversion bandDropOrder exists to prevent, and month-to-date is structurally the largest
	// figure here, so it is the likely case rather than the exotic one. Enumeration had made the
	// COUNT monotone in width and left the SET free to change shape.
