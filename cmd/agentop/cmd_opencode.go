const openCodeUsage = `agentop configure opencode — route OpenCode through Cortex via its background service

Usage:
  agentop configure opencode enable | disable [--yes] [--config PATH] [--opencode BIN]
  agentop configure opencode status [--config PATH] [--opencode BIN]

OpenCode's traffic does not leave from the opencode you run. One background
service per user, "opencode serve --service", sends every session's requests;
the first client starts it and later ones reuse it. The service keeps an
environment of its own, which it takes over the one it inherited, so that is
where the routing goes. Every change is made with the opencode CLI
("opencode service set env" and "opencode service unset env").

enable sets the nine variables "agentop exec" sets, reading the addresses from
~/.cortex/config.yaml so they match the proxy:

  HTTPS_PROXY  HTTP_PROXY  https_proxy  http_proxy      the forward proxy URL
  NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS                                   ca.crt
  SSL_CERT_FILE  GIT_SSL_CAINFO                         bundle.crt: the bridge CA
  REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE  CURL_CA_BUNDLE                    plus the platform roots

"agentop exec --help" says why each gets which file. enable refuses to overwrite a
value someone else set and leaves every other variable alone; the only values it
replaces are Cortex's own, such as a proxy at an older Cortex address. Its first
run records the nine in ~/.cortex/opencode-state.json, counting Cortex's values as
absent, so disable removes them rather than putting an old Cortex address back.
disable changes only Cortex's values: one set some other way, even after enable,
is left alone and named. status shows the nine and the running service, and
changes nothing.

Changing the service environment through OpenCode's CLI stops a running
service, and an open OpenCode starts it again straight away, before the change
lands. So when the service was running, enable and disable restart it once
after their change, which interrupts every OpenCode session using it; an open
OpenCode reconnects to it. When there is something to change and the service is
running, or may be, they say so first and ask (--yes skips the question, not the
warning). A service that was not running starts with the new environment the
next time you run OpenCode.

Note: once its service has started with these, OpenCode needs Cortex running —
its requests go to the proxy address. "agentop configure opencode disable" is the
off switch.
