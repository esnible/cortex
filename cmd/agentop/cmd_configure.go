const configureUsage = `agentop configure — point a coding agent at Cortex

Usage:
  agentop configure claude-code enable  [--yes] [--settings PATH] [--config PATH]
  agentop configure claude-code disable [--yes] [--settings PATH]
  agentop configure claude-code status  [--settings PATH]
  agentop configure bob enable  [--yes] [--settings PATH] [--config PATH]
  agentop configure bob disable [--yes] [--settings PATH] [--config PATH]
  agentop configure bob status  [--settings PATH] [--config PATH]
  agentop configure bobshell enable | disable | status
  agentop configure codex | opencode

Agents:
  claude-code    writes the proxy and CA variables into ~/.claude/settings.json, so
                 every session on the machine goes through Cortex. Run
                 "agentop configure claude-code --help" for the detail.
  bob            writes "http.proxy" into IBM Bob's settings.json, so the Bob
                 editor itself goes through Cortex. Run
                 "agentop configure bob --help" for the detail.
  bobshell       defines a "bob" shell function in your shell's rc file, so typing
                 "bob" runs it through Cortex. A different thing from "bob" above,
                 and the two are independent. Run
                 "agentop configure bobshell --help" for the detail.
  codex          not yet persistent — use "agentop exec -- codex"
  opencode       not yet persistent — use "agentop exec -- opencode"

One verb for every agent, because "how do I point X at Cortex" is the same question
whatever X is, and the answer used to be spelled differently per agent: a top-level
"agentop claude-code" for the one agent with a settings file, and nothing at all for
the ones without. The agents that cannot yet be configured persistently say so and
name the command that works today, rather than being absent and leaving the reader
to conclude Cortex cannot drive them.

Three agents persist, by two different mechanisms. Claude Code and Bob read settings
files, so their configuration goes there — the key differs (Claude Code keeps an "env"
block, Bob is a VS Code fork and reads "http.proxy"), and Bob additionally needs the
bridge CA trusted by the OS, which "configure bob enable" prints rather than performs.
Bob Shell gets a shell function written into the rc file instead, so the routing is
applied when you type the command. Codex and OpenCode read the process environment and
nothing else, so their routing lasts exactly as long as the process — which is what
"agentop exec" is for.

"agentop claude-code" is the old spelling of "agentop configure claude-code". It still
works, and prints a notice pointing here.

Exit status: whatever the agent's own action returns (0 applied or already correct,
3 declined, 1 something went wrong), 0 for an agent that only prints guidance, or 2
for a usage error.

// comingSoon is the message for an agent Cortex can already run but cannot yet
// configure persistently.
//
// A helper rather than three near-identical literals: the value that differs is the
// name twice over — once display-cased for the sentence, once as the binary — and
// three hand-written copies is three chances for that pair to disagree. Which is not
// hypothetical; the request this implements had exactly that slip in two of its three
// messages.
//
// Built by concatenation rather than written as a raw string because the message
// quotes `agentop exec -- <agent>` in backticks, and a backtick is what would end a raw
// literal. Printed commands are quoted this way elsewhere too (cmd_exec.go:152,
// main.go's deprecation notices).
// display appears twice: once in the opening sentence and once in the closing
// clause. There was a third parameter for the closing one, on the argument that
// "the thing agentop configures" and "the thing that then runs" are different kinds
// of name and had come apart once — `bob` configured as "Bob" but ran as "IBM
// Bob". That caller is the one this change removes, and with it the only instance;
// both survivors passed the same value twice, so the split had become a claim with
// nothing behind it and a parameter two callers could transpose undetectably.
