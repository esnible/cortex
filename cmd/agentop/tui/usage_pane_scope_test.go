// TestUsageScopeMax_CoversTheWidestHeader recomputes usageScopeMax's allowance from the sources
// renderUsage draws on, rather than from a list written out by hand.
//
// THE HAND-WRITTEN LIST IS WHY THIS TEST EXISTED AND FAILED TO WORK. Its first version
// enumerated grouping strings the renderer never emits ("no breakdown", "by model" without the
// prefix it actually adds) while omitting the longest one it does — "no breakdown for latency",
// 24 columns by itself — and hardcoded one window, so its computed widest was 51 against a real
// 65. It then asserted that 51 fitted the constant, which it did, and passed.
//
// So the inputs come from usageWindows, the metric enum and the grouping branches in
// renderUsage. A grouping added there is the one thing this still cannot see; the switch is
// three lines long and sits beside the format string it feeds.

//
// THROUGH renderUsage, not a hand-built format string. An earlier revision of this test rebuilt
// the header itself; the two agreed exactly, so there was no live defect, but a change to the
// real format string would have moved the header and left this test green against its own copy.
//
// ASSERTED AS AN OVERFLOW, not as a fit. The header still runs past an 80-column terminal on the
// latency metric at the longest window, because usageScopeMax's 24-column floor wins there and
// returns more room than the line has. That floor is deliberate — a scope nobody can read is
// worse than a wrapped line — so this records the cost rather than asserting a fit the code does
// not deliver. If a later change removes the overflow, this fails and says so, which is the
