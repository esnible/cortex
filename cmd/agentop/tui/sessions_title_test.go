// THIS TEST REPLACES A CHARACTERIZATION. sanitizeLabel covered the BIDI overrides and isolates
// (U+202A-202E, U+2066-2069) and stopped there, so the plain MARKS — U+200E LRM, U+200F RLM,
// U+061C ALM — and the zero-widths passed through untouched. The test that used to sit here recorded
// that as a deliberate reliance on core/session.sanitizeTitle stripping them upstream, and said in
// its own doc that closing the gap should DELETE it rather than invert it. This is that deletion.
//
// WHY THE RELIANCE WAS WRONG. The comment it justified claimed the served path "does not rely on the
// producer" — while the only thing keeping a mark out of the cell WAS the producer. /v1/sessions is
// unauthenticated and operator-pointed, the proxy's normaliser is unexported in another module, and
// this is the rune class whose entire function is to make the rendered order differ from the byte
// order: "report\u202Egnp.exe" reads as something else on screen. A cross-module invariant is a poor
// place to keep that, and pipeline.IsControlRune already named the full set.
//
// THE MARKS AND THE ZERO-WIDTHS ARE DIFFERENT ATTACKS, asserted together because one predicate now
// covers both. A mark REORDERS what follows it and needs no matching pop, so one is enough. A
// zero-width makes two distinct titles render identically, so a row can wear another session's name
// while nothing addresses it by that name.
