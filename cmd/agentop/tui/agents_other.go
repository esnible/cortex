// otherAgents is the AGENTS row, and the scope, for everything no recognised agent accounts for:
// every unrecognised User-Agent's traffic, and every session that names no recognised agent.
//
// WHY ONE ROW AND NOT ONE PER User-Agent. The server reports an unrecognised agent under its raw
// User-Agent, and one program sends several — the IBM Bob IDE was three rows before it was
// recognised (#1210), and the one that read as Bob carried none of its tokens. Worse, none of
// those rows could reach a session: a session names an agent only when the proxy recognised it,
// so picking a raw User-Agent scoped the list to nothing. Pooling them makes the picker a
// partition — every listed session belongs to exactly one row — so no pick can hide a session
// that no other pick shows.
//
// NOT A LABEL THE SERVER KNOWS, so it never goes on the wire as agent=: a proxy would narrow to
// the literal string and answer zero. fetchUsageScoped and fetchUsage fold it client-side
// instead. It cannot collide with a real agent either way — "Other" is no canonical name, and a
// client that sent "User-Agent: Other" is unrecognised and belongs here anyway.
//
// The raw User-Agents stay visible where they were: the unscoped spend drawer's agent axis and
// `agentop cost --by agent` both show them, which is how a new agent gets noticed and added to
// pipeline's knownClients.

// knownAgentLabel reports whether label is a recognised agent's row rather than Other's.
//
// FOLDED FIRST, so a versioned label from a server that predates the fold ("claude-code/2.1.285")
// still counts as Claude Code. The same predicate decides series and sessions alike, which is
// what keeps the partition consistent across version skew: an agent the proxy recognises and this
// binary does not lands in Other on BOTH sides, with its sessions beside its spend.

// foldOtherAgents returns a copy of a group=agent snapshot with every unrecognised series merged
// into one otherAgents series, so ScopeToAgent, NarrowToAgent and agentRowsFromSnapshot all treat
// Other as one more agent with no code of their own.
//
// THE CAP'S "(other)" BAND FOLDS IN TOO. It is the server's overflow past MaxSeriesInResponse —
// traffic no series accounts for — so it is unattributable by construction, which is this row's
// definition. Totals and every window-level field are untouched: the series are regrouped, not
// recounted.
//
// Counts.Add, so a fold of several saturated series saturates rather than wrapping.
//
// SeriesCurrencies FOLLOW THE SERIES: Other's units are the union of the units its members
// reported. A member the producer named no units for makes Other's units unknown, and unknown
// falls back to the window's list — over-refusing a mixed figure rather than labelling one agent's
// spend with another's units, the same trade agentRowsFromSnapshot makes.
